# Angular-Homes-App
The basic angular tutorial application with some fixes, made to work with angular 17

#### Future updates 

- For now there is no https request handling, this is not necessary for this proyect just because it is a test (check the console on the browser to see the data retrieved from the graph), however it is nice to have and I want to add it.

- Images: There have been some issues with the images, this have been mentioned on offcial Angular repos, for now a single image is used for all listings. Im looking for a more elegant solution to shoving images into the assets folders, however I feel like this is the most bulletproof solution as of now, more investigation is necessary.
