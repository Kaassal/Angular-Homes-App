# Angular-Homes-App
The basic angular tutorial application with some fixes, made to work with angular 17

#### Future updates 

- For now there is no https request handling, this is not necessary for this  just because it is a test proyect for me to get familiared with Angular if you want to see the data being retrieved you can do that by checking the console on the browser, however it is nice to have even if its only at a local level I want to add it.

- Images: There have been some issues with the images, this have been mentioned on offcial Angular repos, for now a single image is used for all listings. Im looking for a more elegant solution to shoving images into the assets folders, however I feel like this is the most bulletproof solution as of now, more investigation is necessary.
